EMG Prosthetic Arm
Overview
In India, the cost of a new Myoelectric/Bionic prosthetic arm can range from 1 lakh to 2 lakh rupees, making it unaffordable for many middle-class and lower-middle-class patients or amputees. This project aims to design and build a far more affordable and pocket-friendly prosthetic arm with Myoelectric capabilities. Using 3D printing for the structure, servo motors and Arduino for mechanical functions, and Myoware muscle sensors to read muscle-generated electrical signals, the cost of the prosthetic arm is significantly reduced, making it more accessible for patients and amputees.

Features
Cost-Effective: Uses 3D printing with recycled PET filaments to minimize production costs.
Advanced Control: EMG sensors provide precise control over arm movements.
Durable: Built with high-quality components like MG995 servo motors.
Sustainable: Incorporates recycled materials, contributing to environmental sustainability.
User-Friendly: Includes wireless operation features and a companion app for easy monitoring and control.

Components Used
EMG Sensors: For detecting muscle signals to control the prosthetic arm.
MG995 Servo Motors: To manage the arm's movements.
3D Printed Parts: Using recycled PET filaments for a cost-effective and sustainable build.
Lithium-ion Battery: Rechargeable power source for the prosthetic arm.
Arduino Microcontroller: Manages the arm's operations and connectivity.
Myoware Muscle Sensor: For reading electrical signals generated by muscles to control the prosthetic arm.
How It Works
The EMG prosthetic arm uses sensors to detect electrical signals generated by muscle movements. These signals are processed by the microcontroller, which then drives the servo motors to move the prosthetic arm accordingly. The use of 3D printed parts made from recycled PET filaments helps to keep the production cost low while ensuring durability and sustainability.

Business Potential
While this project is focused on providing affordable prosthetics to those in need, it also presents a significant business opportunity in the growing prosthetic limb market. The goal is to offer this innovative prosthetic arm at a fraction of the typical cost, making it accessible to a broader range of users, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

Conclusion
The EMG prosthetic arm project represents a breakthrough in affordable and sustainable prosthetics, combining cutting-edge technology with practical design. This solution not only addresses a critical need but also holds strong potential for market growth in the prosthetic limb industry.
